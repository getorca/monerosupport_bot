First, the blockchain sync, which is basically downloading the blockchain from other nodes / peers. Second, the wallet sync, which is the wallet \"refreshing\" / scanning blocks looking for transactions belonging to your address / wallet. Since you're using a remote node, you're skipping the first step. Thus, the status indicator on the left bottom (of the GUI) is showing the number of blocks it still needs to refresh. If it states `Connected` it's fully refreshed and should show your balance.\n\n------------\n\n&gt;I just downloaded the latest v0.11.1.0 linux 64bits from getmonero.org, I'm running ubuntu 17.10\n\nIf you still want to run a local node, could you try the following steps:\n\n1.

Still it seems the path i gave was working, because i can see it creates a new .lock file every time. (Which i tried deleting before rerunning).\n\nHave you tried using the command prompt (cmd) instead of the PowerShell? Also, are you certain the blockchain in your custom data directory is *not* corrupt? More practically speaking, what happens if you rename `data.mdb` in the custom data directory to `data-old.mdb` and subsequently start `monerod.exe`? \n\n&gt;I think it has something to do with the amount of addresses i am generating.\n\nThe first number is the number of accounts that are *pre*generated, whereas the second number is the number of subaddresses per account that are *pre*generated. Using a value of `3:200` simply means that you can utilize 3 accounts with each 200 subaddresses. Note, however, that you can recreate the wallet with a different subaddress lookahead value (e.g. 5:300 in case you run out of accounts and/or subaddresses). \n\n&gt;But how does this relate to the seed stored on my ledger? \n\nSubaddresses are deterministic, i.e., a given 24 word Ledger mnemonic seed will always generate a certain set of Monero accounts and subaddresses. \n\n&gt;Would changing those numbers mean i create a wallet that does not own the funds that i received using the GUI wallet?\n\nTheoretically a copy of the wallet with a lower subaddress lookahead could miss / not spot a certain transaction. For instance, let's say you sent funds to the subaddress in the first account with index #75 of wallet A (the initial / original wallet, which has a subaddress lookahead value of 3:100). Now, let's say you recreated this wallet (wallet B) with a subaddress lookahead value of 3:50. This second wallet (which, to reiterate, is a copy of wallet A), would not spot the transaction, because the funds were sent to a subaddress that has a higher index # than the amount of pregenerated subaddresses.  \n\n&gt;If i create a wallet using other software such as moneruju with my ledger, will that wallet have the funds? (the same funds existing in the wallet i created with ledger and moneru GUI)\n\nYes :) \n\nHopefully it's sufficiently clear now. If not, don't hesitate to ask further questions. \n\nP.S.

Thus mining should continue whilst people compete with fees to get their transaction into a mined block.  \n\n\nHowever, if Monero were to try this same approach, given that they have an adaptive block size, it might not work so well. The flexible block size decreases demand for block space, and thus transaction fees would be less than in Bitcoin.  \n\n\nSo their method of solving this is to have a 0.3XMR per block \"tail emission\" that incentivizes the continuation of mining?","score":2,"subreddit_comment":"monerosupport","body":"Honestly I usually make this comment the other way around, but this is more suitable for /r/Monero lol","score_comment":3,"id_comment":"e7icnhd","comment_count":1}

Let's say you have a $10 bill in your purse and are buying something worth $7. At the checkout, you hand the cashier your $10 bill and receive $3 in change. Monero works similar, if you have a 10 XMR output and intend to buy something worth 7 XMR, the wallet will use that 10 XMR as input, create a 7 XMR output for the recipient, and a 3 XMR output that goes back to the sender (you) as change. In case of sending a transaction, the wallet balance will thus first subtract the full input amount. The balance will reflect properly again once the change is received.

I would suspect that your balance is greater because you received the change from your transactions, which just accumulated.\n\nSo if your balance is too big it's because your view-only wallet is only viewing (correctly) the incoming transactions, which I think includes the changes from your previous transactions.\n\nI know you're using the GUI, but can I ask you to try the following steps on the CLI wallet so you could inform your view-only the correct balance?\n\n- Using cold wallet, command `export_key_images &lt;filename&gt;`. There will be a file with `&lt;filename&gt;` created in the working folder.\n\n- **Copy** the file to the hot wallet computer.\n\n- Using watch only wallet, command `import_key_images &lt;filename&gt;`. The watch wallet is now aware of spent status for each output and it shows the correct balance.","score_comment":2,"id_comment":"eg0qhyg","comment_count":1}

Did I get it correctly that every wallet (= private key) has only ever one single address starting with 4... (primary account, first address) and ALL OTHER addresses of all accounts and subadresses are always starting with 8...?\n2. Why do so few applications (software wallets) provide a feature to \"prune the wallet\"? Like, if I mistakenly create another account or subadress I don't want to use (yet), there is no way to \"delete\" it. This counts even for the official Monero cli and gui wallet. And counts for Monerujo.\n3. Now the interesting question: How is a wallet balance computed? I already verified that account address generation and subadress generation is obviously deterministic: If i delete and restore a wallet, I'm starting of with only my primary \"4...\"-adress and generating additional accounts and subadresses will create always the same values for the wallet. So now what I don't get: If a wallet balance has to be computed, the whole blockchain has to be scanned for all possible accounts and adresses of a wallet, right?\n   1. What is the limit of accounts and addresses per wallet? Could a wallet contain millions of addresses?\n   2. But for such a wallet it would probably take a very long time to scan the balance, right?\n   3. What if a wallet contains 100 accounts, there is some XMR on account 1, the following 98 accounts are empty and on account 100 there is again some XMR. How is it possible to intelligently scan the blockchain with such a \"data structure\"? Like, how does the wallet software know what is left to scan?\n\nThanks. Just trying to understand the math behind it all a little better.\n\nBtw, I love Monero. I mean, l really love it so much. It's so great. Thanks to all devs and the community, I love you guys! You are the best :-D","score":3,"subreddit_comment":"monerosupport","body":"First, welcome to Monero! I'll try to address your points in order to avoid confusion.\n\n- Yes, each Monero wallet has one \"main\" address and as many subaddresses as you'd like. It's important to note however, while these are convenience features and the addresses are unlinkable to eachother, they're not actually what makes Monero private. If you give both Alice and Bob the same subaddress and they send you Monero to it, by watching the blockchain nobody will be able to tell that both Alice and Bob sent to the same address - in fact nobody will be able to tell Alice or Bob even sent anything at all.\n\n\n- Subaddresses are just redirects to your main wallet. You can create 50, lose 10, give 30 away then restore your mnemonic a year later. All the funds will appear in your main wallet and you never have to worry about recovering the subaddresses in the future. So wallets don't care if you create one that you don't want, and it doesn't really matter that you do.\n\n- Wallet balances are computed by scanning the blockchain to see which transactions \"fit\" your private key. If you can read the transaction, well you have access to the funds so it's obviously yours. It doesn't matter if they sent it to your main address or a subaddress derived.\n\n- There is no limit for how many addresses are in wallets. However, the standard is to only check for the first 200. If you generate a million, you'll have to tell your wallet about it.\n\n- Subaddresses scale infinitely I'm pretty sure, so it won't take substantially longer to sync if you have 10,000\n\n- If you have 10 XMR in the first account, then 99 empty accounts, then another 10 XMR, it will scan just fine. As for how it works, subaddresses are all derived from the base private key, so you don't actually scan the blockchain for each subaddress, you scan the blockchain for which one fits your one private key. If you find a match, you look up which subaddress it matched with. \n\nHopefully that explains it! Let me know if you have any other questions and I'm gonna tag /u/SamsungGalaxyPlayer just to make sure I got that last point right.  ","score_comment":2,"id_comment":"ei82lz1","comment_count":1}

First, the 25 word mnemonic seed is a representation in words of the private spend key. Secondly, your keys are stored in the `.keys` wallet file. However, this file is protected by your password. Additionally, there are essentially three ways to restore a wallet:\n\n- Via the 25 word mnemonic seed. \n\n- Via the `.keys` file and the corresponding password.\n\n- Via the private spend key in case it is deterministic. In case the private spend key is non-deterministic, you need the private view key as well (a deterministic spend key allows on to derive the private view key). \n\n&gt;Is it my wallet file, or my wallet.keys file? \n\nBoth are part of the wallet. However, I'd consider the `.keys` file significantly more important, as it contains your keys. \n\n&gt;Does my wallet cache have my seed?\n\nNo. The wallet cache merely contains information related to your wallet and the state of the wallet. That is, it contains the private transaction keys, recipient addresses, address book entries as well as the current state of the wallet. \n\n&gt;If nobody knows my password, then having my keys file is meaningless I suppose?\n\nCorrect.

Is there a way to restore destination adresses","selftext":"Hi there,\n\nwhen I recover a Monero wallet only from the seed, is there any possibility to reconstruct the destination addresses of my spent outputs? When I recover a wallet and look through the history, I only see the spent outputs without any destination addresses.\n\nIt seems not even possible to generate a transaction proof, even when I enter the recipients address by force. All I ever get is a longer transaction proof that can only be validated against the transaction ID. But for a 3rd party, this is worthless information, because the transaction is private.\n\nFor me, this looks like a problem, because a wallet where I store the file has more functionality than a wallet reconstructed from the seed.\n\nFor example:\n\nI buy something in XMR. Lets say I spend 1 XMR on a toy. The seller denies that he received the correct amount of XMR. Maybe he tells I only sent 0.1 XMR. So I need a 3rd party to judge (Imagine we live in a crazy future world where everyone pays in XMR and the authorities are OK with it)...\n\nWith my intact wallet that did the transaction I have plenty of possibilities to prove that I sent 1 XMR to the seller. For example the 3rd party could tell me any message, and I can generate a new transaction proof signing the tx id, recipient and the message. So anyone can verify this and gets as an output \"Recipient 4... got 1 XMR in tx\\_id\"However, with a wallet reconstructed from a seed, it is not possible. Is is only possible to verify that I conducted the transaction with a certain tx id.\n\nIsn't that a problem? Or am I missing something.\n\n**TL;DR**\n\n1. Why can my \"local wallet\" prove a transaction including the recipient's address and return the amount, and why can a wallet recovered from a seed not do the same thing?\n2. How do i prove \"I sent 1 XMR to address 4.../8... in transaction tx\\_id (including some message)\" with a wallet recovered from a seed?\n\nThanks!","score":8,"subreddit_comment":"monerosupport","body":"&gt;Why can my \"local wallet\" prove a transaction including the recipient's address and return the amount, and why can a wallet recovered from a seed not do the same thing?\n\nThe private transaction key is generated randomly and is non-deterministic. It thus cannot be regenerated upon restoring a wallet from the 25 word mnemonic seed. Furthermore, it cannot be retrieved from the blockchain. \n\nThe only way to utilize the private transaction key is to retrieve it from local storage (private transaction keys are stored in the wallet cache of the wallet that performed the transaction). \n\nSimilarly, recipient addresses are only stored locally. They thus cannot be regenerated upon restoring from the 25 word mnemonic seed.  \n\n&gt;How do i prove \"I sent 1 XMR to address 4.../8... in transaction tx_id (including some message)\" with a wallet recovered from a seed?\n\nYou can basically use the spend proof feature, which does not require knowledge / possession of the private transaction key. The spend proof basically proves that the transaction was signed / created with your private spend key. In the CLI, you can use `get_spend_proof` to obtain the spend proof for a certain transaction and `check_spend_proof` to verify the spend proof provided by someone. I'd advise to use `help` in `monero-wallet-cli` to see the exact usage of the commands.","score_comment":3,"id_comment":"elnnw9h","comment_count":1}

If it does, I do have a simple solution:\n\n1) Place your router in the DMZ area of the ISP modem. Use a different private IP range for the router from that on the modem. Turn off the WiFi on the ISP modem, if this is not possible use a long hard to guess password for the WiFi on the ISP modem. \n\n2) Do not connect anything else than the router to the ISP modem via either wired or wireless. This includes ISP TV or VOIP services. If you have such services, and they do not work with your router, cancel them and get only Internet from your ISP.\n\n3) With the above setup the double NAT is effectively eliminated and the modem should forward each port to the corresponding port on the router. \n\n4) On the router one can then forward the appropriate ports to computers on the LAN to run services, including a full Monero node.\n\nI use this exact setup to run not only a full Monero node but also full Bitcoin and Namecoin nodes without any problems.\n\nEdit: If the DMZ does not work with the setting above, one can also forward the ports one needs from the Modem to the router. For example on the Modem forward port 18080 to port 18080 on the router for Monero. If there are other connections to the Modem then the Modem will not  forward all the ports to the corresponding port on the router so this is why the setup may fail. This is the reason why the router should be the only connection to the Modem","score_comment":2,"id_comment":"en8lz4b","comment_count":2}

I keep getting a note to allow incoming traffic on port 18080 or 18081. I've done that in the firewall and it solved nothing.

Note, however, that no incoming connections does not inhibit the daemon from syncing properly. \n\n&gt;me that ports are not the problem\n\nCorrect. \n\n&gt;Port forwarding is not an option with my setup as I don't have access to the router or its interface at all.\n\nYou can still run a node with merely outgoing connections. Though, a node that also has incoming connections is better for the strength and decentralization of the network, as it can serve parts of the blockchain to other (new) nodes. \n\n&gt;Any ideas?\n\nDo you have sufficient free disk space on the default drive?

Balance 0 and some random crashes toward the end of the sync.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI then thought, maybe it's something with my node, and connected to the eu node of the official cake node. The same result. Sync finished with no transaction in sight and no change of balance. As if I never sent the XMR. What strikes me is that if only Cake behaved consistently, because weirdly enough a couple of times it did see the 10 XMR and I think once even updated the balance.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo what gives?","score":4,"subreddit_comment":"monerosupport","body":"Could you perhaps try restoring from the 25 word mnemonic seed?

A daemon on the other hand is a service that normally runs in the background, invisible to the user. The monero daemon is responsible for synching your local copy of the blockchain with all the other nodes on the internet worldwide. This process takes a lot of time, especially with a fresh installation. The daemon then basically has to start from scratch and download the whole monero blockchain (dozens of gigabytes of data) and process it, which depending on your cpu speed, internet connection speed and type of storage can take at least hours, but more likely days to complete.\n\nThis is the most secure way to run the software as you have your very own copy of the blockchain after it is completed and don't have to trust any third parties.\n\nInstead of downloading the whole blockchain, you can also opt for using the software in simple mode. Monero GUI will then rely on a remote server to provide the blockchain data for you. This opens up a lot of possible man-in-the-middle-attack vectors if the remote server acts malicious, and is not recommended for large amounts of Monero.\n\nRunning the GUI in bootstrap mode is a hybrid of the two above options: You basically start in simple mode and can use the software instantly, but a local copy of the blockchain is downloaded in the background.

It has downloaded close to 16GB as I type. \n\nWhen I type ‘status’ into daemon log, it reports \n\n&gt;\t\\&gt;&gt;&gt; status\n[14.11.19 20:42] 2019-11-14 19:42:04.260 I Monero 'Boron Butterfly' (v0.14.1.0-release)\n2019-11-14 19:42:04.313 I Generating SSL certificate\nHeight: 1356116/1966956 (68.9%) on mainnet, not mining, net hash 131.71 MH/s, v5, update needed, 8(out)+0(in) connections, uptime 0d 1h 13m 49s\n\nSo it seems to be syncing although the GUI reports the network status as disconnected.\n\nThe tiny amount I sent to the wallet for testing purposes earlier still doesn’t show up in my balance either. \n\nAre Catalina’s enhanced security features effin with me?","score":3,"subreddit_comment":"monerosupport","body":"First of all, you are mostly experiencing issues because we are in the middle of releasing a new version. The new version of the CLI (which most nodes use) is already released, but the new GUI release is still forthcoming. Unfortunately, GUI v0.14 does not allow for version mismatches. Put differently, it cannot connect to a remote node that runs v0.15. This will be solved in GUI v0.15, which should be out soon. \n\n&gt;So it seems to be syncing although the GUI reports the network status as disconnected.\n\nIn the default wallet mode (`Simple mode (bootstrap)`), the GUI wallet connects to a remote node whilst your daemon (monerod) syncs in the background. Once `monerod` is fully synced, the GUI will switch to your own (local) node. Now, what is happening here is that the GUI cannot connect to the remote node, but the daemon (monerod) still properly syncs. \n\n&gt;The tiny amount I sent to the wallet for testing purposes earlier still doesn’t show up in my balance either. \n\nTo put your mind at ease, I'd advise to run this guide:\n\nhttps://monero.stackexchange.com/questions/6137/how-do-i-as-a-recipient-verify-that-my-transaction-actually-arrived\n\n&gt;And now are both, monerod and Monero GUI, downloading/syncing the blockchain? This is ridiculous. \n\nNo, only `monerod` downloads the blockchain. \n\nIt is a bit unfortunate that you got an unsatisfactory first time experience (predominantly caused by the release cycle). \n\nDo you have an SSD with sufficient free space as default drive? Then I'd advise to perform the following steps:\n\n1. Go to the `Settings` page.\n\n2. Close the wallet.\n\n3. Select `Advanced mode` as wallet mode. \n\n4. Reopen your wallet via the `Open a wallet from file` option. \n\n5. The GUI will now use your local node only (which is essentially `monerod`). However, before you can properly utilize the wallet, you will have to wait until the blockchain sync is complete. This may take some time, but shouldn't take longer than 10-12 hours if you have an SSD. \n\nIf you do not have an SSD (or do not have sufficient space), please let me know and I will provide other steps.","score_comment":2,"id_comment":"f7isspj","comment_count":1}

Although the hashrate per GPU will increase as well, it will be less, I think like 50-100% increase.

At that time I also purchased a Ledger Nano S and I transferred the Monero and some other coins to the Ledger. No problem. Later in the year I purchased a Nano X. I initialized it with my 24 word recovery phrase. No problem there either. In both cases I used the latest Monero app and the latest Monero GUI.\n\nYesterday I was considering purchasing some more Monero so I grabbed the hardware wallets and when I plugged them in I saw the apps were old. So then I did something I now greatly regret. I updated the firmware on both of them, also the apps. I also updated Ledger Live and the Monero app. Then I checked the balances on both the hardware wallets. The non-Monero coins all had the right balance. So then I went to the Monero GUI app and the problems began. First of all, I had a very hard time getting the GUI to connect to the daemon. I am using an iMac, a fast one, running the latest version of Catalina. I eventually got it to work using the Simple mode. I have not been able to get the GUI to talk to the daemon using Simple mode (bootstrap). Anyway with simple mode, the GUI says I have no Monero. This is terrible. I had a lot (for me). I am devastated. I do see others have similar problems so I hope this is a software problem and someone didn't somehow steal my coins. I also wish I had not upgraded both Ledgers. I will never do that again.\n\nHere is what I see on my Monero GUI in Simple mode:\n\nIn the lower left corner it shows \"Wallet is synchronized. and Daemon is synchronized (2024923).\n\nOn the Info tab it shows GUI version v0.15.0.2, Embedded Monero version [0.15.0.1](https://0.15.0.1/), Wallet restore height: 20040101, Wallet mode: Simple mode.\n\nIn the upper right it says 0 Monero!\n\nHere are all the relevant version numbers:\n\nOSX Catalina 10.15.2\n\nLedger Live: 1.20.0\n\nMonero GUI: 0.15.0.2\n\nNano X firmware: 1.2.4-1\n\nNano S firmware: 1.6.0\n\nMonero app on Ledger X and S: 1.4.2\n\nAs I said, in addition to my possibly lost Monero, I am unable to get the app to work at all in any mode but simple mode. I get Wrong Device Status errors and messages that say the GUI cannot connect to the daemon.\n\nBut the most critical problem is that I cannot find my funds.\n\nPlease help!\n\nEDIT: More to tell...\n\nI tried Simple Mode (bootstrap). Something is really messed up. Looking at the activity monitor on MacOS Catalina, I see the Monero GUI. Sometimes I see monerod. When I first start the GUI, it creates monerod and monerod begins to talking over the inet. Then something, I bet its the monero gui, kills monerod. Later it will restart it but it does not try to talk. I have also seen the gui start multiple instances of monerod. I have seen as many as 4 instances of monerod.\n\nIs this normal behavior?\n\n&amp;#x200B;","score":5,"subreddit_comment":"monerosupport","body":"The multiple instances of monerod might just be some parallelization optimization.

It is important that you specify your wallet with the rpc-payment-address option They are not earnings every time they use your server ....","score_comment":2,"id_comment":"fiv0xi7","comment_count":1}

[Missing address] my wallet suspended suddenly !!","selftext":"**02.29 update**\n\nFirstly, I solved the issue by myself. Unfortunately, I could not get any reply mail from mymonero support team till now. I would like to share about **mymonero** problems.\n\n**1. The missing address issue.** \n\n\\- I created a Mymonero wallet and received some coins in same day. I have used mymonero since longtime ago and It was first time to hold over 100 XMR. When I could not access the wallet, I tried to recover 25 words Monero seed on Monero GUI desktop app. BUT I got 'Illegal public\\_address' error message and I could not see the balance as well. I was not sure why It happened because the 25 words Monero seed should be no problem. Before having 'Illegal public\\_address' error message from GUI, It was 'Missing address' error from Mymonero. (You can see error images from comment section) So, I thought there is a problem with my wallet on that time. Yesterday, I tried to recover the seed again on CLI and It was successful to generate new wallet by the seed but problem was, I got different wallet address. As I know, It should be same wallet address even though I recover from other places but It was totally new wallet address. I really worried and It was quite slow to have blocks so I tested to recover same seed on Mymonero. and... It worked suddenly. I could not open the original wallet but I could create new wallet by seed. The wallet address also exactly same with previous and all balances were there. I am not sure till now why it was different wallet address when I generated new wallet from CLI. By the way, because of this experience, I can not hold big amount in mymonero anymore.\n\n**2. Displaying wrong amount**\n\nWhen I sent coins from Mymonero, usually displaying amount has been changed very often. For example, I sent 10 XMR to other wallet but suddenly the transaction shows like sending amount is 50 XMR or full amount of that address instead of 10 XMR. When it happened at first, I was panic as well but after some time, It displayed correctly. Mymonero team should fix this thing. I thought Mymonero is just simple app to use but I felt like still incomplete. \n\n==============================================\n\nHi.\n\nYesterday I tried to make a \\[mymonero\\] wallet and I exchanged some coins to XMR and received it to \\[mymonero\\] wallet. After exchanging, I tried to login but I got \" **An unexpected application error occurred** \" error suddenly. I thought it was server error at first. So, I tried to search on google about the error but I could not find a proper solution for this.\n\nThe wallet was displaying \"**Login error** \" instead of showing amount. I had no idea what happened. So, I tried to recover the wallet by 25 Monero seed from Monero Official GUI desktop, but I failed to connect. The error was\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\" **Please let us know of the following error message as it could be a bug:**\n\n**managedKeyImageCacheldentifierForWalletWith: Illegal public\\_address** \"\n\nThe bug error message was \"missing address\" at first but it has been changed to \"illegal public\\_address\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I saw this error message, I was panic because I just exchanged my other coins to XMR. I could not understand how it could be illegal activity. I have proofs for this and I guess, It happened because I traded some transactions at same time.\n\nP2P Crypto Trading can not be illegal. Please help me to solve the issue.","score":3,"subreddit_comment":"monerosupport","body":"Illegal in this instance is in a programming sense, not a legal sense.

I mean, if you're off by a digit or two, the address will probably be invalid so there's very little risk of sending to a wrong address. I just think it would be easier / just as safe to save the address to a flash drive with PGP, or with some other digital + encrypted transmission scheme.\n\nI guess the only thing I might add, is to churn your Monero to yourself once, and to only spend one outputs at a time. You can manage this in the GUI by using separate accounts, or the CLI offers the 'sweep_single' command.\n\nAdvice on churning seems mixed from what I've seen. Some say it's not necessary, but my understanding is that it won't hurt and may very well help. When you churn, your spend is no longer connected directly to the output sent by the exchange, which should make any analysis or inferences harder to make.\n\nOnly spending single outputs is important because you generate a Ring Signature for each output spent, where the real input is 1 out of the 11 ring members, but outside observers don't know which one. If you spend two outputs in a single transaction, you've associated two rings with one another that wouldn't be associated, if you spent the inputs separately.\n\nIf you are going to be receiving to the same wallet more than once, you should also be aware of [this attack](https://web.getmonero.org/2019/10/18/subaddress-janus.html) and use separate private keys as necessary.\n\nYet another thing to consider is this. If you're only buying what you need when you need it (and doing what with the change, discarding it, sending it to a new wallet?) then it's possible that the transaction could be linked by the amount + the time. If you purchase 200ish dollars worth of bitcoin just a few hours before you are suspected of conducting a 200ish dollar Monero transaction, a lot can be inferred from that. So you wouldn't necessarily want your fiat purchases to line up with your Monero purchases in that way.","score_comment":2,"id_comment":"frnqv2a","comment_count":1}

(Can't check the exact version at the moment, for the reason in the subject line!)\n\nAs the subject line states, I have been on the revolving icon of \"Creating transaction\" for, oh....about two hours!  I am reluctant to give it the Windows 3-finger salute of closing the application down entirely for fear it will either corrupt the local database (which happened to me on another machine once) or affect the transaction in some other way.  I have reached out to the recipient to cancel it on their end, if possible, but I would still like to know what's going wrong to cause this. It's not a HUGE amount of money, but it's still annoying and something I would like to prevent in the future.\n\n(Last second edit:  I got an error message once before regarding something about the API, but when I tried again it went ahead and is in the current state it is now.)\n\nI'm not running the database on an SD drive (not enough space), but even on a conventional hard drive I gather from other postings that this should not be taking *this* long.\n\n\\-First, what can happen if I forcibly shut down the Monero software?\n\n\\-Secondly, what's the cause?

They have direct fiat pairs for XMR (i.e. EUR and USD) as well as a BTC pair. \n\n&gt;which is not anonymous and completely destroys the point of buying XMR in this way. \n\nNo, it does not. Please see Rehrar's excellent comment on the matter:\n\n&gt;I am open to being corrected, but this seems excessive if Monero is not illegal in your country. People think that you have to buy Monero anonymously to retain privacy. And while there are some attacks that can be done via KYC/AML exchange (like the EAE attack), for the most part, we don't have to worry about any of this with Monero.\n\n&gt;It's like me going into a bank and taking out cash. The bank knows I have cash, and how much, but as soon as I leave the bank they don't know if I spend it, where I spend it, or how much I spend.\n\n&gt;Monero is similar to this. If I buy Monero from a KYC/AML exchange, all the exchange knows is that I have Monero in the amount I purchased it. As soon as I take it off, they don't know what I do with it, or where it goes.\n\n&gt;So while you actually can be a little more lax with something like Monero, everyone should be taking precautionary measures (similar to above) when transacting with Bitcoin, Ethereum, or any other transparency coin.\n\n&gt;All of this obviously depends on your threat model, but I would say that the only threat model using the above methods would protect against is if accessing Monero was illegal, but not accessing cryptocurrencies in general (since you're purchasing USDC or ETH from a KYC/AML exchange), which, to me, seems like a pretty narrow threat model that not many would be using.\n\n&gt;TL;DR: I think the above is overkill except for very few, unlikely, threat models, and Monero's power comes in its simplicity to use after it's purchased (with a couple of exceptions via attacks that MRL is working hard to mitigate).","score_comment":2,"id_comment":"fus8xwu","comment_count":1}

(w/ Ledger + Wallet GUI)","selftext":"TL;DR - Ledger + GUI Wallet changed receive address multiple times on #1 and #2 Accounts; lost a transaction (and faith in the system...).\n\nI setup a new hardware wallet with Ledger Nano X and the Monero Wallet GUI (on Linux) and created a couple additional accounts in the GUI. Later, I went to account #1's Receiving tab and copied the address and verified the pasted value was the same address. A short amount of time passed before I executed the transaction but it went through just fine.\n\nHowever, the wallet never updated with my new funds. As I was clicking around, I went back to the #1 Receive tab and noticed the address was different than what I had copied earlier! I thought that was odd, so I checked the other two accounts, copied their addresses before closing the wallet and restarting it. When the GUI started after approving it on the Ledger the #1 and #2 accounts had changed their Receive Address again!! This was now two changed addresses in two different accounts from when I first used &amp; copied the initial address.\n\nThis was yesterday. I just started it all again today and it does have the same address now as that third, final address... but what the hell? This has made me lose faith in this system... as well as lost XMR :(\n\nIs there anyway to get my initial address I transacted with back into my wallet? It was created by the wallet in the first place...\n\nAlso, I'm scared to keep using this if these addresses are just going to get dropped and re-created at-will... how do I ensure the addresses in the wallet are stable??\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nUPDATE:\n\nOkay, so, if I open the Wallet GUI I need to auth with the Ledger, which must be in its account \"XMR / 1\" Once I have the GUI opened, if I switch the \"Account\" on the Ledger Monero App on the device, the #1 and #2 GUI accounts change their address, and the device \"XMR / 2\" with GUI Account #1 has the address I used in the transaction. However, and still unfortunately, the balance there is still 0 but, as I used this address in the first transaction, it SHOULD have the funds there, right?\n\nWhen I do change the Ledger account to \"XMR / 2\" it gives me a different \"4\" primary address than the GUI Wallet, which still shows the Ledger's \"XMR / 0\" address, even though the #1 and #2 GUI Wallet addresses change.\n\nFINAL UPDATE (and fixed!):\n\nOkay. I figured it out. Thanks to [u/selsta](https://www.reddit.com/u/selsta/)'s  comment below I realized if I change the Ledger Account on the device  while the GUI Wallet was opened, it was changing the addresses in the  GUI for my non-primary accounts (#0 GUI Account was always the same as  the Ledger \"/0\" Account). When I changed the Ledger to the \"/2\" account I  saw the address of my GUI #1 account matched the address I used in the  transaction, though, it still said \"0\" balance.\n\nSince the GUI #0 account was not updating, I figured I'd try something that ultimately worked:\n\n* I closed the GUI Wallet &amp; disconnected the Ledger\n* I opened the Monero app on the Ledger and, first, went to the \"/2\" account under its settings.\n* I then opened the GUI wallet and \"Created a new wallet from hardware\" with this \"/2\" account selected on the Ledger.\n* Once  in the GUI I added a #1 account. (the GUI Wallet then crashed, but I  re-opened the noew created wallet and tried again; second time it  worked).\n* The now #1 GUI account had the funds I transferred.\n\nAnyway,  this feels like some sort of bug between the GUI Wallet and Ledger...  I'm glad I figured it out, hopefully this post could help someone else;  especially a n00b who confused \"Account\" in the GUI Wallet with  \"Account\" in the Ledger Monero App Settings.","score":5,"subreddit_comment":"monerosupport","body":"To be clear, in the GUI you can have multiple accounts, which are basically mini-wallets within the wallet.

If the attacker restored the wallet on a different computer, and swept the funds, you would see an outgoing transaction with no address (as in [this example](https://imgur.com/a/k9hXeha)).\n\nThe reason for this is that the \"to\" address can only be \"decrypted\" from the transaction if you have the transaction private key. This isn't generated deterministically, but is stored locally. MyMonero (and every Monero wallet) provide no functionality to share those keys with other instances of the wallet, they are all local to that particular installation, and if you delete the wallet and restore it that information is gone forever.\n\nEither you swept the wallet yourself, and don't remember, or an attacker has access to your computer (physical or remote).

I briefly looked over it. It could be streamlined and beefed up. At this point, if you're seriously getting into being your own bank, you owe it to yourself to have a dedicated banking computer (if you can). The steps described there are a hack to effectively make your existing computer a virtual second computer. If you choose to get a second computer, oddly enough, the older the device, the better. You can get reeeeaaalllly deep in the weeds regarding what is the best banking computer. I think core2duo's are the last line of intel's that don't have any backdoors. I forget though.

That means the node is having to sync up to the network every time you connect, which might end up being slower than a remote node. On the other hand, if you can and don't mind leaving the node &amp; hotspot running most of the time, it's probably worth it. Mobile hotspots can be pretty fast and if your node isn't accepting incoming connections, the daemon doesn't need a ton of bandwidth.\n\nAs far as the SSD, it's usually recommended and would probably help despite your slow connection. I know it's said to speed up initial node sync which in your case may or may not be true, but I think it would also speed up wallet syncs.

Just rescan, right?\n\nBackstory: Roughly 120 days ago I had to switch to a Windows machine briefly, and when I churned some of my XMR then, I accidentally did it on the wrong chain via a remote node (I think) as there had been a fork at some point, and I hadn't touched my Windows machine in ages and forgot to update the GUI+CLI. Thus, said tx was sent to pending hell, but I didn't have issues in future churns.

It's a cat-and-mouse game, with changes in tactics to work around mitigations against the attacks that Monero devs put into the code. I would say the game is in its third round, at the least.\n\nThose daemons lie to the \"honest\" nodes, to confuse them, to prevent them from fully syncing to the network, and to make wallets connected to them stop working. They also try to prevent that they see other honest nodes.\n\nWhy, even after several point releases, are the Monero daemons still not fully immune against those attacks? Here opinions vary. The attacking dev for example says that Monero devs quite in general are incompetent, blinded by following a cult, or just not caring enough because too busy counting the XMR they make from the sheeple.\n\nI would say Monero so far had it a little too good on the technical front, never having to fight against any serious attack against the network. Its dev community was caught on the wrong foot in some respects, and it took time to find the right angles how to mitigate.\n\nWith so many new release over such a short time, there is now also the problem of updating all the nodes to the latest version, which is indeed still not fully immune but already a lot more resilient than the version at the start of this all.","score_comment":14,"id_comment":"ggg8z9l","comment_count":7}

If you have 12 or 200 out-peers, the only thing that can help you is in the last block it reaches you with 1 / 2s faster since in the end you download it of the nodes where you connect. You do not harm the network. the sooner you receive the last block, the sooner the nodes connected to you will receive it. You could perhaps say that it helps in propagation in all nodes but indirectly. Your node depends on the nodes you connect to. So if you have, for example, 50 nodes configured for outgoing connections, you will notice some improvement in the synchronization since each node you connect will be different. (network, storage, cpu etc). With the recent attacks I personally would put 50 as out-peers. The ssd is recommended because the synchronization is much faster. Even once synchronized, each block that arrives is synchronized much faster than in a conventional hdd, so the nodes connected to you will have the same benefit, having the last block before. To summarize, it is not the same to have a node on a pi4 with a hdd than on a linux server with an intel xeon and a ssd or ssd / m2. The most powerful PCs in the end are better for propagation in the p2p network. I think the high speed is not so important since by default the download is 8MB /s (64mbps) and the upload 2MB /s (16mbps).

Like an idiot I sent it all (not many, but still) at once instead of testing it with a small amount. \n\nOn the Bittrex side, it has left the account and I have a tx ID. \nOn the ledger, I can open the Monero app on the ledger and I see XMR/0 followed by an address. \nOn the GUI side, it spent the rest of the day trying to sync and would kick me out for inactivity, causing me to log in again.

I'm assuming that XMR/0 means there are no coins on the ledger. The GUI wallet never indicated that it held any coins but I can't even check that now to be sure. I would guess the answer to this will determine what I should do next. \n\nWould it be alright for me to just delete Monero GUI for now and have the computer reformatted or would I potentially lose those coins? \n\nAny and all assistance is greatly appreciated, I'm sure I'm missing details so feel free to ask clarifiers.

I'd love to use one of the laptops to put up a public node. \n\nApparently I have to open port 18080 on my router. My router is supplied by the isp(the notorious Comcast/xfinity), and there are other people in the house who aren't going to want any changes on any of their devices. I also just don't want to hear from the isp, they're supposed to be Comcast, not Momcast. Will opening port 18080 be a problem? Are there any ways around it, like a vpn with a static ip? I know vpns aren't generally helpful for privacy but could this be an exception? I'm willing to pay the small amount per month for the good feelings I'd get by contributing all I can. Especially if I can pay in xmr. \n\nMy current understanding is that having the port open isn't actually a huge risk because no other computers in the house would be listening to that port, just the laptop I set up as a node, so an attacker that got in would only have access to that laptop and nothing else, is this correct? Assuming the other devices in the home are regular windows 10 with regular firewall rules and typical Android phones. \n\nWould Comcast take notice of a customer opening ports on a combination modem/router supplied by them? I assume getting my own router wouldn't help because it would still go through the modem, am I wrong? I know they'll know I'm running a monero node.\n\nMy roommate knows what I do with monero, it's not a secret or problem. However, the Internet subscription is in her name (I pay my share!) and both she and I agree that it's not cool for her to hear from Comcast because of something I'm doing as a hobby, especially during covid while she needs the Internet to work from home and I don't. \n\nTl;dr: What's the difference in privacy and security opening port 18080?

Yesterday I had 37 xmr in my wallet and wanted to exchange it to btc so I could more easily cash it out to my bank account.  I used changenow.io and first sent 10 xmr as a test to make sure it would work like I thought.  It did work as expected and I got my btc.  Then I sent 22 xmr to convert more into btc and worked like a charm as well.\n\nI was going to leave approximately 5 xmr in my wallet for a rainy day.  I’m using the MyMonero wallet app for iOS.  Everything seemed fine.  Then a few hours later I went to my MyMonero wallet and my balance showed 0xmr.  I looked at previous transactions and I could see a confirmed transaction that was made about an hour after I did my previous conversions - emptying out the wallet.  That transaction did not show a recipient address or secret tx key - and from what I gather this means the transaction was not originated on MyMonero on my phone.  Ie it was stolen.  Is this correct?\n\nIf so, what info would someone need in order to do this?  Is having my seed the only way this is possible?  What does the secret tx key do?  I’m such a newbie and I’m used to using btc - I didn’t know how to look up my tx on the blockchain.  So I went to a monero block explorer site and ran some search queries... I entered in my wallet address, my payment id, my tx id and also my secret key into the search.  I was just hoping one of them would bring up something showing the transaction was confirmed - I was just trying to track it.  Does this secret tx key allow anyone to gain access to my wallet? Is it possible that searching that key on a site was my downfall?\n\nI don’t really know how anyone could’ve gotten my seed.  I don’t think I stored it anywhere and I verified the seed by writing it on paper and throwing that away months ago.  I’m confused as to how this could have happened - is having my seed the only likely way this is possible?\n\nAgain I’m very sorry for such a newb question - I’m familiar with btc and have used it very much - but xmr is very different and foreign to me.  I really want to hold xmr but I’m afraid after this - I want to know what possible security mistake I could’ve made.  Any help would be appreciated.

ChangeNOW here — please allow us to explain what we believe might have happened:\n\nSince we need to send you the funds after an exchange, the network fee is already included in the exchange rate of an asset that we show you. If the network fee increases during the moment of exchange, the rate you receive might also change. Exchanges in smaller amounts are especially affected by these changes since the ETH transaction fee does not depend on the number of funds you send.\n\nYou can use 'Fixed Rate' instead of a 'Classic Rate' if you want to be protected from the market fluctuations and network fee changes — this way, we take all the risks associated with the rate change.\n\nHope to have shed some light on the possible reasons for that, and thank you for contacting us!","score_comment":5,"id_comment":"gnj4nak","comment_count":1}

This is probably reasonably low-risk, though there are some basic measures you can take.\n\nAt minimum, I'd suggest running the monero daemon as a separate user from your personal account. So if some well-crafted hack does break out, it only has access to the blockchain -- not to your wallet files.\n\nRunning a monero node on a cheap dedicated hardware like a Raspberry Pi is even more secure, here's instructions: https://monero.stackexchange.com/questions/11877/benefits-of-running-a-monero-gui-and-full-node-over-raspberry-pi-with-tails-rath\n\nOr for very high security and minimal fuss you can rent a cheap VPS; a $5/mo DigitalOcean drop will suffice for a Monero node.","score_comment":3,"id_comment":"go19xsn","comment_count":1}

Going back and forth between Parrot OS and Windows 10.  These two transactions were made with Windows 10, but I've encountered the same issue on Linux Parrot OS which is what I started with.  I would like to just use Linux.  The problem with that is so far I have only been able to run Linux from the USB boot stick I made.  I haven't been able to install Linux to run from my harddrive.  I gave Linux it's own partition, but I can't get it to see the partition as anything but unallocated, unusable space.  I mention all this because every time my PC reboots, I lose everything that I created during the previous session.  I got tired of re-installing everything over and over each time I had to reboot.  I would like to be using Linux instead of Windows 10.  The biggest heartbreak in this regard was losing several days worth of blockchain download when I was trying to get my own local node.  I'm now trying to get the blockchain downloaded on my Windows machine.  Seems like the more chain that I get, the longer becomes the time estimate for completion of the entire chain.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAre you using a wallet in conjunction with a Ledger or Trezor device?\n\n    No.  Would it help if I did?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDo you run AV (AntiVirus) software?\n\n    Yes.  But I turn it off when dealing with Monero wallet.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAre you using Tor or i2p in any way?\n\n    The recipient of the funds is a TOR exchange who claims that their system doesn't recognize my transaction IDs.  I don't use i2p.  What is it?  Should I be using it?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    This is probably too much detail, but I'm new at XMR and after a week of frustrating problems, I realize I need to reach out for help.  I have many transactions stuck in blockchain limbo.  For now I really want to pursue just two of them.  If I can get these fixed which are the two biggest and most recent, then I'll spend some time tallying up the others for further assistance.  Most of the others were part of my learning curve.  But these two failed AFTER I had placed successful transactions the same exact way previously..  They failed AFTER I thought I finally got things figured out.  And they account for the significant majority of my missing funds.  Any help/guidance in retrieving this money would be truly appreciated and I'll be happy to help others with whatever I can learn from this.\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------\n\n1st Amount:\n\n    0.578778135048 XMR\n\n2nd Amount:\n\n    0.56449926824 XMR\n    \n\nMy Monero GUI Wallet Address for Reimbursement:\n\n    46DQdJLNSnsXEzsoJVzoYdeTym1RxdUCCYqt3ixw3YS1gLv7JcqsnQbLDVLQemBzztaPPe487NJCgYBftdqpnttxPJV8DZw\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFull Details Below...\n\nI don't know if I'm putting this request in the right place.  Someone else directed me here from another forum (XMR.to).  If this isn't where I should post this request, please point me in the right direction.\n\n6 Days ago I sent two XMR transactions, each roughly $135 USD value, to an onion address through a trusted remote node that worked for me before.  I want to use a local node but it's taking forever to download the blockchain and it seems like the more that it downloads, the longer the remaining estimated time becomes.  It's a head-scratcher.  The party receiving my transfer imposes a time limit of 3 hours in which to complete a transaction.  I had previously sent smaller amounts that processed without a hitch.  These two transactions did not arrive before the 3-hour mark.  The system on the other end does not recognize my Tx IDs which is the only way to submit a help ticket, and so I could not submit one.\n\nI have provided the data from the transactions section of my Monero GUI wallet and more data from XMRchain called up via the Tx ID.  I'm just trying to be thorough, not knowing what all you would want/need to see.  The first transaction showed a recipient address earlier today (it had one showing since about 8 hours after the transaction was initiated, 6 days ago).  However, it now has gone back to saying \"unknown recipient\", just like the other transaction that is lost in limbo.  Both of these transactions were attempts at placing the same order two different times.  At the time I didn't realize that this money was just going to keep floating around in the blockchain and not come back to me on its own.  That was foolish lack of foresight on my part, and now I'm in danger of being short on rent next month if I can't figure this out.  I would really appreciate some help and guidance here.  Also would like to understand what happened and get some tips on avoiding this problem in the future.  I don't even know what caused it, but I'm trying to learn.  Thank you.\n\n\\--------------------------------------------------\n\nTransaction #1  (The most recent)\n\ndata from my wallet:\n\n    Fee:  0.00047831 XMR\n\nConfirmations:  \n\n    4206 (as of now,

I know monero is supposed to have a 25 word seed, but i only have 24 words.\n\nFrom research online i saw that many people thought that repeating one of the existing words at the very end would work, and with one word it did pass electrum style verification but it also ended up restoring a completely different wallet with a completely different seed.  I don t know why this is, but it obviously didn't work.\n\nBecause of this i am guessing that maybe i just missed a random word somewhere in the middle of the seed, and the ending word is the real checksum\n\nI'm fairly familiar with monero, I run a node and use CLI but this one wallet I made I messed up with.\n\nI feel like i may have written the words down like this:\n\nWord1, Word2, Word4, Word5.... and ended up just missing one somewhere in the middle\n\nI also still have the .keys file (which I saved the password in a password manager that died ugh) and the primary receiving address \n\nIs it possible to run some sort of program to test all the possible combinations when i have 24 of the 25 words and i assume mostly (minus the one word) in order?","score":6,"subreddit_comment":"monerosupport","body":"Contrary to what some other people tell you here, and what unfortunately can be found easily with googling, the two \"official\" Monero wallets, the CLI wallet and the GUI wallet, do not insist on 25 words, i.e. the 24 words plus the checksum word.\n\nYou are allowed to enter 24 words, and that's considered a valid way to restore a wallet, and is indeed working correctly **if** those 24 words themselves are correct. Of course the wallet has no way to check the seed for validity if you omit the checksum word, so you could say it's not recommended.\n\nThus if you use your 24 words you got to restore the wallet, and the restored wallet has the wrong address, you do have some mistake in your 24 words, like you said maybe an omission somewhere when writing down the seed. (That would be roughly 40,000 possibilities to try, if a quick calculation of mine is correct, but it might be something else than an omission ...)\n\nIf you had a strong password for you wallet, and now lost that password, also the .keys file is of no use.","score_comment":2,"id_comment":"gobbje4","comment_count":1}

Very sorry it happened to you! I actually think that I used this EXACT same website, this xmrwallet dot com website myself one day, like about 3 weeks before ALL of my monero was also emptied out of my GUI wallet just a couple of weeks ago! Ughhh. I've been rackin my brain trying to figure out how I lost all my monero ever since!\n\n   Mine was taken right out of my GUI in all of 1 transaction, the transaction said it was sent to some address called \"Unknown Recipient\". \n\n   So when someone in these comments said that xmrwallet dot com is a scam place, I totally believe them! But are they saying that this site right here-  [https://www.xmrwallet.com/#/login.html](https://www.xmrwallet.com/#/login.html) \\- is a scam? Because it's right there on google, right now, still, for any and everybody to hop right on in and start \"using\" it. \n\n   I mean, it looks real as any website I have ever been on in my life! And when I looked at it just now it does look just like the one I did go into 3 weeks or so before mine was stolen 2 weeks ago. In fact, it prob IS the one I went in and I probably opened a wallet there or something! \n\n   I can't remember what stupid actions I did now but knowing me, I prob opened a wallet there and who knows what I put there cuz I was so new that I was completely stupid, doing bunch of trustworthy stupid things online, thinking no one would be able to steal our monero now a days. Haa! WRONG I was!\n\n   I just realized one more thing I didn't know until I just saw a thread on here about Monero \"avoid\" if you use Monero. Well, reading thru it real quick just now I see it has the \"avoid changelly\" in there. \n\n   I most definitely used that Changely place to exchange some Ltc and some Btc xmr one day just before mine got stolen. Not 3 weeks prior to mine getting stolen by \"Unknown Recipient\", like only just a day or 2 before. \n\n   So I just found out two new leads as to what I might have done wrong to cause me to lose all my xmr. I wish I could just figure it out so I could prevent ever losing all my monero again. That was a sick feeling watching it being taken out of my GUI. I was there when it was happening! I was actually able to see and watch confirmations going on when I caught mine getting stolen. That made it even worse,! haha! Like pouring gas on the fire. \n\n   I am so sorry this was long! But lastly, is it possible that I and the op could have used or could still use any type of setting in our GUI that makes any type of transaction to any \"Unknown Recipient\" impossible? If I could have done that I would have. I just didn't know if there were a setting I could turn on or off that allows or prevents \"Unknown Recipients\" from making transactions remotely from inside my GUI?? I mean, they didn't even know my password to get in the GUI. THAT seems too easy to me. And it also seems too easy to be able to prevent tis sort of thing from continuing to occur at this point in development. Just my opinion. Not anything sarcastic by no means.

(You can probably preload the whole thing by doing something like `dd if=data.mdb of=/dev/null`.)\n\nAfter this, if you start another application that needs some of the RAM, the operating system will take care of evicting some of the least-recently-used pages of the blockchain to make room for that.\n\nIn other words, there is almost certainly no need to do anything funky like put the lmdb data in tmpfs or anything like that.","score_comment":3,"id_comment":"grvawhr","comment_count":1}

MyMonero is also not working because you have to pay for them to sync your restored wallet from a previous block height.\n\nSo if my assumptions are correct, and they might not be, you need to do the following:\n\n* Restore your Wallet A on the GUI, without using the Ledger. You can use a remote node (simple mode on GUI)\n* Create a new wallet using your Ledger + GUI. This will be wallet B.\n* Create a subaddress and/or take note of your main address.\n* Once synced, your money will appear on Wallet A using the GUI. You should then send this money to your wallet B.

I have tried to do this so far, however, I have no luck with connecting to the daemon using the local ip and default mainnet port. I use the rpc-bind-port setting for the daemon and daemon-address, and trusted-daemon for the XMrig miner, however I get the error message that the daemon either is not running or I have specified the wrong port. While my understanding probably is not 100%, I have attempted to forward the 18081 on my router, but no luck anyhow. Any ideas on how I can accomplish this, or am I trying to accomplish something that can't be accomplished?\n* In extension of the last question, in a feble attempt of accomplishing a faint version of the above, I have tried to connect the CLI wallet to the remote daemon as well, however, no luck here either. Can this connection from a CLI wallet on one machine, to a daemon on another, only be accomplished as according to the official guide for connecting through TOR?\n* From my searches on the internet, I have found this tool to create a private pool [https://github.com/sammy007/monero-stratum](https://github.com/sammy007/monero-stratum) however, the last update seems to be a couple of years old, as well as the posts I read, that recommended the tool. I therefore have concerns as to whether it could, and/or should still be used in 2021? Also, would it be safe to run a pool this way, if not what threats should I expect?\n   * If this tool is not recommended to use in 2021, are there any tools that are, or am I bound for solo mining on established pools, if I desire to compound my efforts?\n* While \"off-the-shelf\" tools like XMrig, and the pooling possibillities mentioned earlier, are great for getting started, and getting the first glance of the technology behing cryptos, they also greatly depend on trusting the developer of said tools. I would therefore also be interesting in resources on how to code tools myself. \n\nI hope that I have not been too vague in what I search for, and that you will be able to help me better find the resources that I need, in order to better support the network. Preferably the tools or resources would be for linux, although all options are appreciated. \n\nAgain, I stress that making a profit is not a requirement, and I am aware that I will not do so.","score":5,"subreddit_comment":"monerosupport","body":"Feel free to post this on r/monero too.","score_comment":2,"id_comment":"guxy3up","comment_count":1}

Don't get me wrong, I believe it is safe, but for what reason exactly is there no POINT TO POINT, or PEER TO PEER exchange system? Decrypting an algo is not something you need a supercomputer for. Simply inputing the key using a bar code, or qr code scanner should be enough to tell the other device what the key is. This allows for point to point transactions without them being displayed, or put through / on / or in, an online ledger... really... there is no reason for it other then the ability to track and trace.\n\nI guess the short question is why can't I turn off my wifi and data and use blutooth or USB cable to transfer the coin using the hardware locally?\n\nI have been thinking a lot about this, and while the convenience of having the capability to transfer over the internet is nice, but should not be a requirement for a TRUE private coin. There is no reason to send the information over the web (for possible inspection, or scrutiny, or interception), when someone is infront of you looking for a couple coins to buy for example a TV.\n\nNot only this, but if an internet blackout occurs, or your wireless fails, there should always be a means to exchange coins peer to peer. Anything less then the ability to peer to peer screams potentially intrusive layer.\n\nAnyway... those are my thoughts... they may seem unwarranted to many, but privacy is privacy... and the internet is anything but. Anything over the internet becomes public domain.

Currently, I am syncing the blockchain from block 0, if it is done does that automatically mean I run a local node?\n2. Does running a local node mean that everyone uses it to broadcast to the network or is it more like a private node to broadcast my own transactions?\n3. Can the local node be accessed by anyone or is that not possible? If so, can this be done with malicious intent?\n4. If the node can be utilised by other people, Will they only be able to use my node if it is fully synced and the GUI wallet is open or is the node connected to the network if my pc is just on?\n5. Do I have to run the monero GUI wallet in order for it to sync in the future or does/can it sync at random moments while using my pc?\n6. I used a remote node for my first few transactions, is my IP now linked with an address or is that data not stored on the nodes? If so should I change wallets when I fully synced the blockchain myself?\n\nThanks in advance","score":6,"subreddit_comment":"monerosupport","body":"1. Yes\n2. You will receive new transactions that your node may end up \"fluffing\" or broadcasting. Your own transactions submitted through your node will generally be fluffed by other nodes. Read about Dandelion++.\n3. You want to carefully review the documentation for monerod at [MoneroDocs](https://monerodocs.org/interacting/monerod-reference/). By default your node will only help you and will not help the network. Generally, you will want to forward port 18080 through your router so that other full nodes can download blocks from you, helping to seed the network. If you are bandwidth constrained or only occasionally run monerod, then you don't need to do anything.\n4. This depends upon how you are running monerod. If you are only launching it with the GUI and shutting it down when you close the GUI, then there is your answer. If you run monerd separately and keep it running, then it will do what it will do until you shut down the PC.\n5. Same as the above. You can start monerod independently of the GUI (which I recommend) and leave it running, preferably 24/7. If you exit monerod in any way then it will have to sync and catch up to the network the next time you start it.\n6. Your IP generally can not be connected to your \"4\" or \"8\" address because of how Monero constructs transactions (read about stealth addresses). You don't have to change wallets. A remote node might be able to link your IP with the transactions you sent through them, but not your real address.","score_comment":3,"id_comment":"gvxgts1","comment_count":1}

I successfully loaded the full blockchain and created a wallet using the 'Create from hardware wallet' option.\n\nSo far, so good, but the wallet does not scan if i do not export the view key.

I have deactivated the auto-lock, the Ledger Monero App was open the entire time.\n\nBy now i have tried pretty much everything. Re-created the wallet again and again, used the CLI instead of the GUI, changed the block restore height, changed the subaddress lookahead. Nothing. The CLI just hangs at 'Starting refresh' without anything happening for hours.\n\nI have transferred some Monero to the account via an exchange, and if i export the view key the wallet can sync and shows everything correctly.

It's a very big bummer of an  expensive lesson and I want to pass it on. For anyone that reads this,  immediately move your monero to a new address if you entered your  mnemonic seed phrase/private keys on their site. I don't trust them at  all.\n\nI've used that webwallet for  years and had no problems. I ALWAYS checked the URL in my browser to  make sure it wasn't .org/.net/.in or anything else. The strange thing is  that the Monero were safely sitting there since 2018 when I moved it  from an exchange due to hacking concerns. I did a transaction in January  2021 and it wasn't until months later, in April of 2021, that the whole  balance was withdrawn. That is what gets me. The delay before the  withdrawal.\n\nI've been racking my  brain to try to figure out if I somehow I transferred it and forgot, but  I can't remember anything and was very surprised when I had a zero  balance. I did not move them to an exchange, and I don't have another  monero address. I also wondered if my seed words could be compromised. I  store them offline, and no one has access to them, so I don't know how  anyone would get them. I do copy/paste from the password protected file  to the web address when I log in, so maybe my computer is compromised,  but nothing else has been messed with and there was a many month delay  since I used the seed last.

Now the new wallet I downloaded (in advanced mode as well) will not sync. It won't even try to connect to remote nodes, it lets me add them but says \"disconnected\", it does not even appear to be trying to connect. And the local node daemon will not sync completely. I tried to restore it once, when I was able to get that far, and it didn't work...but I don't know that the daemon was completely synched, I have yet to get both bars to sync fully, only the bottom bar. Please go easy on me, I realize I got in a little over my head regarding my level of understanding, I'd like to get my coin back not even get the thing to and restore my wallet if possible but I have no idea how to do that since I connect.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAny help is appreciated.","score":3,"subreddit_comment":"monerosupport","body":"You should be able to restore in Simple Mode, which will autoselect a node for you to use.

You do not depend on it, you just need a device with a hardware randomizer that generates the seed for you. Of course it does also sign your transactions safely - but you do not really depend on it. If you don't like it, you can convert your seed to a monero one and use it.\n\nAfaik there was a dedicated cold storage wallet for monero in the works, but seems like they stopped development.\n\nTrezor is good too, but it does not have the best physical protection since it does not use a secure chip (though risk is minimal.. who has the stuff at home to actually break in).\n\nMy highest hopes are for shiftcrypto/bitbox. Monero is high on their list for coin implementation but they are buy with other stuff. Like Trezor, everything is open source + secure chip. I love their BitBox but had to buy a ledger for having XMR and Nano in cold storage.\n\nLedger is closed source (the firmware, not ledger live), so yes, you have to trust them. But I trust a secure chip with a hardware randomizer 1000x more than any computer - even airgapped.","score_comment":2,"id_comment":"h0ac0h3","comment_count":2}

One I have used for several transactions, while the other was created but never used. Last evening I did transfers of 13.579 XMR and 9.526 XMR both from the first to the second. According to the XMR blockchain, the transfers were both successful. This was over 200 confirmations and eight hours ago. Unfortunately, the destination wallet, still has zero balance and shows no transaction history. The source wallet also has a balance of zero. I've checked and rechecked the source and destination addresses and they are right according to the blockchain, but all 23.105 XMR is unaccounted for. What happened? I can give transaction ids and public keys to anyone interested in helping. If this turns out to be an inconsistency in the blockchain, how would I get in contact with the XMR developers so they could determine what happened since that would be an important problem if I'm not making a mistake. I've even cut and pasted all the addresses involved and dropped them into a spreadsheet so I could easily compare them automatically to ensure there were no typos involved - everything checks out. All I can say is I have proof of spending to the destination wallet, and a destination wallet that shows no balance and no transactions present.\n\nI should probably add that I've used independent machines and platforms to check this out, and manually checked the blockchain using different online blockchain explorers to rule out any local bugs with my wallet software. In other words, I've restored the wallet to other places including online web-based XMR wallets to check many different ways. So this cannot be blamed on any local bugs with software on my machine.\n\n\\-gt-","score":3,"subreddit_comment":"monerosupport","body":"Hey everyone!!!

My Monero wallet won't sync with Daemon or start. I made sure to allow permission for Daemon to run despite it being an \"app from an unauthorized developer\" by Mac. A user on telegram instructed me to enter this terminal command: monerod --db-sync-mode safe:sync, and I got the message: -bash: monerod; command not found. A few weeks ago, I erased the free space on my Mac, but the Monero wallet should not have been considered free space. I also deposited funds into the wallet successfully after I did the free space erase, so I think something else is going on. I am hoping that there is some kind of remedy for this. Thank you in advance for your help. PS I am not using TOR. I do use a VPN, but that has never posed an issue before. I'm not running antivirus software.

Alice provides a list of 4 decoy outputs + their actual output which holds 1 XMR\n2. Bob provides a list of 5 decoy outputs + their actual output which holds 5 XMR?\n\nThis creates a ring signature of 9 decoy outputs and 2 outputs that actually correspond to Alice and Bob's output and subsequent private keys. \n\nOnce this ring signature is generated, bob signs it and sends it to Alice, who also signs it.

Sigh a heavy breath of relief and donate funds to the folks that helped me.\n\n**Where I think I went astray:**\n\n* Restoring from `wallet.trezor.io` is slightly DIFFERENT than through the Suite. Browser asks if you want to enable passPHRASE or not, suite does it automatically. This is the root of my issue. In my previous troubleshooting, I was using the browser to wipe and restore. Because it prompted me to enable passphrase I declined because I didn't remember setting one. I didn't remember setting one because I probably initially setup my Trezor model T through the suite and not the browser, not realizing it had automatically enabled an empty passphrase. \n* **I highly recommend Trezor resolve this discrepancy between their browser and app to prevent future issues like this occurring.**\n\n**Additionally:**\n\n* Disabling passphrase on Trezor after step 11 resulted in the device and monero wallet addresses not matching. After re-enabling the passphrase on Trezor Suite I was able to once again access my Monero wallet. \n* Upgrading to Trezor firmware 2.4.0 and rerunning the wipe/restore process (as described above) resulted in successful recovery.","score_comment":2,"id_comment":"h4ua6cl","comment_count":3}

No, that is not at all how Monero is supposed to work! So I have no idea what is happening there. If, on the other hand, this is \"simply\" a case of missing subaddress, there are two points that could have gone wrong. Your \"recovery height\" and your \"precomputed subaddresses\", it looks like the current wallet will search for transactions to 10k subaddress but it was possible to create millions and billions of subs.

Whenever I tried restoring a wallet I created through Ledger it required the Ledger device to be plugged in.  What happens if the Ledger gets lost or stolen?  When a wallet is created in the GUI using Ledger, the mnemonic phrase appears to be tied to the Ledger seed phrase because it is not shown in the advanced setting for the wallet.  That being said the only way it appears to be able to restore a GUI wallet set up with Ledger is to have that Ledger device in hand or else you're out of luck?  \n\nHopefully this makes some sense.

The blockchain data is stored on an SSD connected via USB2.0.\n\nUsually I start the synchronization with\n\n`./monerod --detach --sync-block-size 10 --data-dir /path/to/my/SSD`\n\nand check the progress with `tails -f bitmonero.log` which seems to work to perfectly at the beginning.\n\nHowever, in most cases the daemon freezes after \\~6-10% without leaving any error on the logfile. When I try to stop the daemon (`./monerod exit`) nothing happens and I need to kill it.\n\nTried it now 6 times. After I had to kill my maximum progess so far (19% after \\~2 full days...) this even corrupted the database giving me a `Bus error (core dumped)` which could also not be solved with the`--db-salvage` option.\n\nNot only the instability but also the synchronization speed is really discouraging at the moment... I checked the writing speed to my SSD which is \\~40MB/s, so a 75GB database should in best case be written in 75GB / 0.04GB/s = 1875s \\~ 31min, so I assume that the USB2.0 is not the bottleneck here but the problem is the synchronization with the network.\n\nAny other ideas on what I could check or change?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGreetz, empoe","score":5,"subreddit_comment":"monerosupport","body":"Hi, I mess around with single board computers (including Raspberry Pis) and Monero a lot and this is almost always either a power supply issue or RAM related on the older Pi3B+.  \n\n\nAn easy temporary fix to counter the possible low RAM issue is to create a 2GB swap file with:  \n\n\n    sudo nano /etc/dphys-swapfile\r\n\n    #edit line 16 to read:\n\nCONF_SWAPSIZE=2000\n\n    #Save and quit with, CTRL+O, then CTRL+x\n    \n    sudo dphys-swapfile setup\n    \n    sudo dphys-swapfile swapon\n    \n    free -h    (command \"free -h\" should show the new line with 2GB swap)\n\nThe other possible issue which may be causing the instability is the power draw of the SSD on the Pi. Check the label on the drive that it doesn't require more than 600mA if you're plugging it into one USB port, or 1.2A if you're using a 'Y' splitter cable to plug it into two.  \n\n\n  \nAnd a final culprit (but a bit of a rabbit hole so please don't get too caught up in it to start with) may be the USB adapter you're using to connect the drive to the Pi. Here is a list of good/bad adapters known to work or misbehave along with some steps to mitigate or work around their limitations:\n\n[https://jamesachambers.com/best-ssd-storage-adapters-for-raspberry-pi-4-400/](https://jamesachambers.com/best-ssd-storage-adapters-for-raspberry-pi-4-400/)  \n\n\nThe Raspberry Pi OS sometimes doesn't treat the adapters as mass storage devices, but I'm not 100% certain it applies to USB2, so don't get caught up in this as it may be a Pi4/USB3 exclusive issue.  \n\n\nAlso you may want to adjust your expectations with the Pi3B+ too. To sync from scratch I would **expect the Pi3 to take several months to sync.**   \nAs others no doubt will point out in other comments here the Raspberry Pi family doesn't support crypto hardware accelerations that a lot of other processors do (called AES). A Pi can perform the function of a Monero node, but it is much less efficient (in terms of processing power) to alternatives. This is why despite the USB2 data transfer speed you mention above being OK, the Pi has to verify cryptographically every block using it's CPU before writing. This is the bottle neck.  \n\n\nThe solution is to copy over a trusted blockchain you have verified on your PC to the Pi.

I wont rule out that some of the issues I was experiencing (i.e. incorrect balances) may have been user error, i.e. the daemon not being synced 100%... but regardless, like I have said, I have always been able to at least get into my wallet and confirm the XMR balance.\n\nWell, today was the first day trying to jump into my wallet for the first time in months. Naturally Ledger had updates, which I installed. Firmware is up to date, and the GUI wallet had an update which I installed. Nonetheless, I was having issues accessing my wallet, so I tried to restore the wallet again using the 25 word mnemonic seed... everything seemed to be going well EXCEPT the Balance was 0 XMR and the restored wallet Address did not match up to the original address (which can be seen on my Ledger Nano S).\n\nGuys, I have tried everything I saw and or was recommended:\n\nConfirmed everything was up to date\n\nI waited damn near all day to confirm the daemon was synced and the wallet connected\n\nI tried selecting an earlier restore height\n\nI tried restoring the wallet under advanced mode so that I could be working off of a local node\n\nI tried restoring using the hard wallet HOWEVER using the mnemonic key option I continued getting an error stating that the device couldn't be found (even though the nano S is on and I am in the Monero app) THEREFORE\n\nI tried restoring using the hard wallet with the private keys, since you can identify the public address, but I don't know how to grab those from the ledger (it appears the private keys are stored within the ledger??)... So I don't have all the information to move forward with this route.\n\nNone of this has worked. All roads have still led me to the same incorrect wallet address with a 0 XMR balance.\n\nI am at a loss, and am a bit worried regarding what happened to my wallet/XMR.\n\nAny advice you could provide would be amazing and greatly appreciated.

It does suck to come to realize that the revolutionary money you thought was going to change the world has fundamental flaws that ... can do more harm than good. So, yeah. \n\nre: supply auditability, this is a good resource: http://monero.supply/ . \nbut basically, for me, it boils down to this - its all still verifiable and auditable, its just done with higher level math than bitcoin. With bitcoin, you can add up all the numbers to see a human number. With monero, a computer can add up all the numbers and get a computer number. It's all still just math. With bitcoin, you blindly trust the math that does all the key stuff. No one bats an eye about verifying (by hand) that the math checks out when you transfer ownership of this amount of bitcoin on blockchain. You just trust the software. You trust the collection of open source coders that have looked at the code. \n\n\nre: storing wealth - the inflation rate is so incredibly small, essentially approach 0% over enough years, that i personally think its a fine trade off. With the constant tail emission, the monero network obtains guaranteed security. The plan for bitcoin to have a fee market secure the network is an unknown. It might work, sure. But it might not, and frankly, if I'm going to be storing my wealth in something, I'd prefer its something that uses a tried and true way to secure the system, and right now, the only tried and true way to secure a PoW cryptocurrency is a block reward. \n\nand lets not even get into ASIC centralization, because to me, that, in combination with the transparency of bitcoin, means that the bitcoin network is on a steady path to become just another central bank. Oh, you want to run an asic farm? You need these permits and have to follow these regulations. Otherwise you can't buy this specialized equipment, which we now control, because we're the state and we like controlling money. \n\nbitcoin was/is a great proof of concept.","score_comment":8,"id_comment":"hid9f2w","comment_count":7}

Thanks in advance!","score":23,"subreddit_comment":"monerosupport","body":"As for monero supply growth, coming from Bitcoin maximalism I can understand why you would think that the inflation is a bad thing but it's not there for no reason. \n\nOne of the key reasons that it's there is because if there's no more emission of coins then the entire network has to be supported by fees, this means that fees must constantly grow over time in order for the network to not become unusable or collapse. Since Monero has a constant emission (which is known and unchangeable) it does not suffer from these potential problems. \n\nThe tail emission is also needed for dynamic block size to work correctly. If you didn't know yet, Monero doesn't have a fixed block size it's blocks grow and shrink based on transaction demand which I think is the best way to tackle the block size problem going from one extreme or the other makes no sense but dynamically changing based on what is needed at the current time makes more sense imo. \n\nAnother thing to add is that the inflation is asymptotically zero, but this is basically means is that when Taylor mission hits at 18.5 million monero (or there about a) the tail emission will be 0.6 XMR per block, however when there are 20 million Monero in a few years the Taylor mission will still be 0.6 XMR per block. Basically, the emission relative to the entire supply falls over time. 0.6 XMR per block when there are 20 million coins, it's much less than 0.6 XMR when there are 18.5 million coins so it asymptotically approaches zero.\n\nThe idea that inflation itself is bad has been pounded into many Maxi's heads, and with good reason. Over the years central banks have destroyed the value of their currencies but they always inflate exponentially. Monero's inflation is linear and cannot be changed, this is a huge difference.","score_comment":5,"id_comment":"hidkggv","comment_count":7}

The project is very script heavy and based on Raspberry Pi OS / Armbian Debian (depending on the hardware a user has) and the recent uplift to \"Bullseye\" has highlighted to me the fragility of my current methods. It is not very resilient to change and the resulting errors.  \n\n\nWhat in the past have been \"quirks\" between OS's and patched between versions seem to now arise as more severe problems and so I need to commit some serious attention to remedying this. My issue as I say is that I don't professionally work within IT and to have got where I am has been self-taught in my spare time and I feel like I need to learn a new skill to fix what I need to... but don't have the time to learn in the wrong direction.  \n\n\nCan someone point me in the right direction:  \nDo I patch what I have?  \nIs Docker the answer to my problems?  \nIs there a better way to standardize a start point from which my scripts are built? ie Use Ubuntu server and pick an LTS so changes aren't as common?  \n\n\n  \nOne example of a problem:  \nInstalling/building Monerod from source worked fine for years on Debian Jessie and Buster. Bullseye is released it's caused an as yet unsolvable issue . However I'm not convinced it's a Monero issue. Part of me is blaming something to do with the OS/kernel, despite trying different hardware [https://github.com/monero-project/monero/issues/8098](https://github.com/monero-project/monero/issues/8098)  \n\n\nSecond example:  \nSo as a patch for the issue above, PiNodeXMR is using the pre-compiled binaries. However we built from source in able to use the onion-Block-Explorer. For which I raised an issue a while back when random-x was introduced. [https://github.com/moneroexamples/onion-monero-blockchain-explorer/issues/211](https://github.com/moneroexamples/onion-monero-blockchain-explorer/issues/211) And this is an error that I can only get (and still get) with Raspberry Pi (again suspecting the OS/Kernel). Now subsequently I cannot build this on Bullseye either.  \n\n\nI know the above is lengthy but I feel context of what I'm currently running into and doing is important. \n\nSo I guess the tldr is that I'd appreciate a chat with someone who is more in-tune than me with current development practices, futureproofing and trends so I can focus in the right direction for the fix.  \n\n\nCheers for your support.","score":4,"subreddit_comment":"monerosupport","body":"Feel free to post your thread on r/Monero as well in order to get more responses / feedback!","score_comment":2,"id_comment":"hq2a9xn","comment_count":1}

Also, English is not my native language, sorry for the mistakes.*\n\nSo this is the story of Changelly.com, a swap website. I used to swap on it without problems one month ago for amounts 10x lower than those.I used it again to swap ETH on Wednesday and my transactions were not arriving on my wallet. When I checked Changelly they displayed as ON HOLD requesting to undergo the KYC process. So I sent an email to Changelly that was the first of a lot of requests they are making to keep my fund. I declined the KYC, they threatened to keep my fund so I accepted and did everything they asked (when it was acceptable - seems like they are soon going to ask for a picture of my girlfriend's boyfriend). Here’s a list of things I provided:\n\n* My ID card\n* A selfie with my ID card in hand\n* A 3D recognition of my face\n* Links to the etherscan of each wallet I used on their website\n* Screenshot of my products details, pricing and wallet\n* Screenshot of trxs on etherscan\n* Screenshot of trxs on my metamask with visible trxs to confirm I own the wallet\n\nI'm writing here to find some help on what can I do to recover my funds? I did everything they asked and they still make fun of me with random new requests every time. Im totally lost, its huge money to me, I spent years to work on that personal project and I don't know what to do. I wish I saw all the scam reports on reddit before I used them… (links listed at the end of this post)What you’re going to read is the most retarded conversation I had with a known service. Not only they refuse to execute the trx, they also lock my fund which is totally illegal. The more I answer their request the more they create new unanswerable requests. Long story short, what they’re saying right now is : “you sent funds, your kyc are not enough to us, we keep your funds”.\n\nHere is the mail convo:\n\nME\n\n&gt;Hello,  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The 28th of December 2021, I started 4 transactions using Changelly to convert ETH. After doing so, my transactions have been put on hold to fill AML/KYC procedure.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;I'm not willing to pass the AML/KYC procedure. Thereby, I request that you cancel my transactions and refund my ETH.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;I acknowledge that the crypto assets will be returned to where it originated from less any applicable fees.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;I also acknowledge I will not be able to use your service until I decide to fill AML/KYC procedure.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Here are the IDs of the transactions :  \n&gt;  \n&gt;&lt;link to trx&gt;                  \n  \n&gt;  \n&gt;&lt;link to trx&gt;                  \n  \n&gt;  \n&gt;&lt;link to trx&gt;                  \n  \n&gt;  \n&gt;&lt;link to trx&gt;                  \n  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Thank you for your time,\n\nChangelly\n\n&gt;Dear ​Customer,​AML&amp;KYC verifications are not just means of your and other customers’ financial protection. They are widely adopted because of their benefits to the safety and credibility of the whole crypto community. We want crypto to be widely available, and it’s mainly possible to achieve with proper transaction verifications.Building trust is the key to everyone’s security.Please note that according to our [Terms of Use](https://changelly.com/terms-of-use), when you use our services, you’re obliged “to agree to pass through AML/KYC procedures, which may be applied to You according to our internal AML/KYC policies.” (2.5.5)Let’s keep crypto safe for everyone!\n\nMe\n\n&gt;Thank you for your fast answer,  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Your vision of \"customers' financial protection\" is far away from the way bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies has been designed. It's a pure old banking way of managing funds.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;I understand you may be forced to AML/KYC for compliance reason. I also know that when I started to use Changelly, I've never been told in a clear way that i may be randomly required to fill AML/KYC else I would have never used your service since I am totally against all this identity tracking institutions are setting up around the crypto sphere.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;I also understand it's your role to ensure your service is safe, but you are still not allowed to lock/steal crypto assets from your users.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;To solve this issue, i have questions I'd like you to answer clearly so I know what are my options.\n\n1. How can I recover my ETH if I don't agree to submit my AML/KYC?\n\n&gt;2) What will happen to my ETH if I fail to pass AML/KYC?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Best,\n\nChangelly\n\n&gt;Dear Customer,  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Unfortunately, the client’s funds cannot be released before all the documents and proofs, required to complete the KYC procedure will be provided.​Upon successful completion of the AML &amp; KYC verification, your transaction that was put on Hold will be processed.​  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Security &amp; Anti-crime Department,Changelly.com​\n\nMe =&gt; Went to the website to do the KYCChangelly\n\n&gt;Dear Customer,  \n&gt;  \n&gt;We’ve got your documents now, thank you!

I understand you’re working hard on protecting users but you’re also prejudicing me for no reason while I accepted to undergo all your requests even if im totally against your market practice and even if I'm pretty sure that you're not legally allowed to hold the funds this way if i didn't want to disclose my identity. I'm loosing a lot of money because of this holding time. The money should already be stacked on DEFI and producing revenues to me.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Also, I spent time to find feedback about Changelly and found out many scary post on reddit showing that I’m not an isolated case. The posts all claim that you're trying to scam funds and I really hope this is not your goal. Be sure that I will not give up on my funds and I will engage any procedure required to defend my case if you’re really undergoing a scam.Best,\n\nChangelly\n\n&gt;Dear ​Customer,  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Thank you for the clarification.Could you please send us full-screen screenshots, invoices, etc., that could confirm that you received payments for the courses you've mentioned?

I'm operating as an individual and I'm not required to provide invoices for courses bought. &lt;details about my selling process using Ethereum &gt;.   \n&gt;  \n&gt;Regarding the other redditors, you're still not allowed to hold funds if your client don't want to KYC. You're supposed to return and not operate the transaction then blacklist the client as your 'Terms of use' used to mention it. For my case, I didn't provide fake documents and answered each request you made. I even had to clarify when they where not understandable and then provided more than you requested.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Also, I'm starting my own public post on reddit and any other changelly related website about what is going on with your service right now.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;It's now time to stop this masquerade and process my transaction or to cancel it and return the ethereum to the original wallets.

I'm trying to figure out another way to prove that the payment as been done for the course but i can't think about something better than those screen shots. As I told i to the live chat I keep no record of my clients everything is done through ETH trx and the only records are their wallet and the amount paid.

That’s now 7 days you have them how many time will it take?\n\nChangelly\n\n&gt;Dear Customer, Since you have not provide any required documents for our KYC/AML procedure, your case is currently being reviewed by our security team. As we already mentioned above, sometimes, it can take us several weeks or even months to check your transactions. This is because a bunch of different stakeholders can be involved in the review process. In most cases, such a lengthy investigation will not be needed. We actively work with agencies and regulators to make the crypto sphere more transparent for all market participants. Since we are not the only ones involved in the investigations, we cannot estimate the exact time required to clarify all the circumstances. Security &amp; Anti-crime Department, Changelly.com\n\nMe\n\n&gt;Since you have not provide any required documents for our KYC/AML procedure, your case is currently being reviewed by our security team. This is false accusation. I provided everything I'm able to provide including full KYC process. You're asking on purpose for documents that does not exists. Release the funds and stop this scam.\n\nMe\n\n&gt;I understood I sent all the proof and answered all your questions + followed the full KYC as requested and you are no more answering my emails.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;It’s now obvious that the only thing you are looking for is holding my funds.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;You are holding those funds without legal basis to do it.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;As a result, I’m starting further actions to recover my funds.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;I reported your scam scheme on reddit here: &gt;[https://np.reddit.com/r/monerosupport/comments/ruas38/changelly\\_a\\_well\\_organized\\_scam\\_system/hqxqvi3/?context=3](https://np.reddit.com/r/monerosupport/comments/ruas38/changelly_a_well_organized_scam_system/hqxqvi3/?context=3) Following this post, I’ll be posting the details of your scam process on bitcoin talk and Quora.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;In the meantime, I’m starting a legal procedure. My lawyer will reach your legal service in the next 48 hours.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThey now stopped to answer and I'm still here without my funds. I spent my new year answering all their questions while they rotate around the same thing. Anybody using cryptocurrencies knows that the only way to prove you own a wallet is to ignite a TRX (or screenshot of metamask). I'm not going to give them my private key to prove I own it. Is there anyone that successfully passed the KYC/AML on a hold trx? Could you please give me any advice on how to solve this puzzle game?Here are some other redditors I found that had the same issue, I contacted them without answer since most of them didn’t report if they successfully recovered their funds :\n\n* [https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/qpu2q2/changelly\\_froze\\_my\\_49000\\_worth\\_of\\_btcusdt/](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/qpu2q2/changelly_froze_my_49000_worth_of_btcusdt/)\n* [https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/qc71iw/changelly\\_froze\\_my\\_transaction\\_and\\_is\\_now\\_forcing/](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/qc71iw/changelly_froze_my_transaction_and_is_now_forcing/)\n* [https://np.reddit.com/r/jaxx/comments/rr2f2y/are\\_my\\_funds\\_at\\_changelly\\_gone\\_for\\_good\\_due\\_to\\_kyc/](https://np.reddit.com/r/jaxx/comments/rr2f2y/are_my_funds_at_changelly_gone_for_good_due_to_kyc/)\n* [https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/qattfg/changelly\\_holding\\_my\\_50k\\_worth\\_of\\_btc\\_08540\\_btc/](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/qattfg/changelly_holding_my_50k_worth_of_btc_08540_btc/)\n* [https://www.cointelligence.com/content/controversy-changelly-changenow/](https://www.cointelligence.com/content/controversy-changelly-changenow/)\n\nSeems like there are lots of gray areas around their company incorporation but I don’t know if it’s real.

I used to swap on it without problems one month ago for amounts 10x lower than those.I used it again to swap ETH on Wednesday and my transactions were not arriving on my wallet. When I checked Changelly they displayed as ON HOLD requesting to undergo the KYC process. So I sent an email to Changelly that was the first of a lot of requests they are making to keep my fund. I declined the KYC, they threatened to keep my fund so I accepted and did everything they asked (when it was acceptable - seems like they are soon going to ask for a picture of my girlfriend's boyfriend). Here’s a list of things I provided:\n\n* My ID card\n* A selfie with my ID card in hand\n* A 3D recognition of my face\n* Links to the etherscan of each wallet I used on their website\n* Screenshot of my products details, pricing and wallet\n* Screenshot of trxs on etherscan\n* Screenshot of trxs on my metamask with visible trxs to confirm I own the wallet\n\nI'm writing here to find some help on what can I do to recover my funds? I did everything they asked and they still make fun of me with random new requests every time. Im totally lost, its huge money to me, I spent years to work on that personal project and I don't know what to do. I wish I saw all the scam reports on reddit before I used them… (links listed at the end of this post)What you’re going to read is the most retarded conversation I had with a known service. Not only they refuse to execute the trx, they also lock my fund which is totally illegal. The more I answer their request the more they create new unanswerable requests. Long story short, what they’re saying right now is : “you sent funds, your kyc are not enough to us, we keep your funds”.\n\nHere is the mail convo:\n\nME\n\n&gt;Hello,  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The 28th of December 2021, I started 4 transactions using Changelly to convert ETH. After doing so, my transactions have been put on hold to fill AML/KYC procedure.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;I'm not willing to pass the AML/KYC procedure. Thereby, I request that you cancel my transactions and refund my ETH.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;I acknowledge that the crypto assets will be returned to where it originated from less any applicable fees.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;I also acknowledge I will not be able to use your service until I decide to fill AML/KYC procedure.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Here are the IDs of the transactions :  \n&gt;  \n&gt;&lt;link to trx&gt;                  \n  \n&gt;  \n&gt;&lt;link to trx&gt;                  \n  \n&gt;  \n&gt;&lt;link to trx&gt;                  \n  \n&gt;  \n&gt;&lt;link to trx&gt;                  \n  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Thank you for your time,\n\nChangelly\n\n&gt;Dear ​Customer,​AML&amp;KYC verifications are not just means of your and other customers’ financial protection.

It's a pure old banking way of managing funds.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;I understand you may be forced to AML/KYC for compliance reason. I also know that when I started to use Changelly, I've never been told in a clear way that i may be randomly required to fill AML/KYC else I would have never used your service since I am totally against all this identity tracking institutions are setting up around the crypto sphere.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;I also understand it's your role to ensure your service is safe, but you are still not allowed to lock/steal crypto assets from your users.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;To solve this issue, i have questions I'd like you to answer clearly so I know what are my options.\n\n1. How can I recover my ETH if I don't agree to submit my AML/KYC?\n\n&gt;2) What will happen to my ETH if I fail to pass AML/KYC?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Best,\n\nChangelly\n\n&gt;Dear Customer,  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Unfortunately, the client’s funds cannot be released before all the documents and proofs, required to complete the KYC procedure will be provided.​Upon successful completion of the AML &amp; KYC verification, your transaction that was put on Hold will be processed.​  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Security &amp; Anti-crime Department,Changelly.com​\n\nMe =&gt; Went to the website to do the KYCChangelly\n\n&gt;Dear Customer,  \n&gt;  \n&gt;We’ve got your documents now, thank you!

I'm loosing a lot of money because of this holding time. The money should already be stacked on DEFI and producing revenues to me.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Also, I spent time to find feedback about Changelly and found out many scary post on reddit showing that I’m not an isolated case. The posts all claim that you're trying to scam funds and I really hope this is not your goal. Be sure that I will not give up on my funds and I will engage any procedure required to defend my case if you’re really undergoing a scam.Best,\n\nChangelly\n\n&gt;Dear ​Customer,  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Thank you for the clarification.Could you please send us full-screen screenshots, invoices, etc., that could confirm that you received payments for the courses you've mentioned?

I'm operating as an individual and I'm not required to provide invoices for courses bought. &lt;details about my selling process using Ethereum &gt;.   \n&gt;  \n&gt;Regarding the other redditors, you're still not allowed to hold funds if your client don't want to KYC. You're supposed to return and not operate the transaction then blacklist the client as your 'Terms of use' used to mention it. For my case, I didn't provide fake documents and answered each request you made. I even had to clarify when they where not understandable and then provided more than you requested.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Also, I'm starting my own public post on reddit and any other changelly related website about what is going on with your service right now.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;It's now time to stop this masquerade and process my transaction or to cancel it and return the ethereum to the original wallets.

I'm trying to figure out another way to prove that the payment as been done for the course but i can't think about something better than those screen shots. As I told i to the live chat I keep no record of my clients everything is done through ETH trx and the only records are their wallet and the amount paid. My metamask screenshot are proofs that only the owner of the wallet can show.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Maybe i can show a part of my selling process filming my screen where you can see a eth trx is ignited on a course, the payment is made, the course is downloaded and then you can see the corresponding trx on etherscan?

As we already mentioned above, sometimes, it can take us several weeks or even months to check your transactions. This is because a bunch of different stakeholders can be involved in the review process. In most cases, such a lengthy investigation will not be needed. We actively work with agencies and regulators to make the crypto sphere more transparent for all market participants. Since we are not the only ones involved in the investigations, we cannot estimate the exact time required to clarify all the circumstances. Security &amp; Anti-crime Department, Changelly.com\n\nMe\n\n&gt;Since you have not provide any required documents for our KYC/AML procedure, your case is currently being reviewed by our security team. This is false accusation. I provided everything I'm able to provide including full KYC process. You're asking on purpose for documents that does not exists.

So, if you have EVER shown anyone your seed words for any wallet in the world out there, or any website out there, or anybody anywhere for any reason, if you've ever let anywhere know what your seed words were, well then, they're goin to wipe ur wallet out. Very soon. I mean cobweb Empty! Not a 1000th of a coin will be left in ur wallet. If u still have crypto in any wallet that you've given the seed words out, then send that crypto to a new wallet...asap!\n\nAnybody that gives their seed words to anywhere is going to be cleaned out real soon afterwards. Or even worse, they may watch and wait till you got a LOT of whatever type of crypto you bought built all up real big, and THEN clean you out.

There isn't 1 reason ever for anyone to need those to be able to help you out or do anything on the internet or whatever their saying to you to get them, so don't ever give them away. \n\nLast- Even if someone tells you smthn can't be fixed or changed or refunded or literally any other reason in the world as to why they want your seeds,  it's a lie. They're lying to you. Period. If you want to just tell them to come on here and explain to me why they need your keys, and I'll help you from there.

Update your ledger live app from your pc to the newest version, connect your ledger to your pc and update the firmware from the ledger live.

In other words, if I leave my node unencrypted, and lose control of the unencrypted drive, will it cause any harm? Sorry, I'm not super familiar with how Monero works, but I got the idea from the fact that malicious or compromised Tor nodes can be used to deanonymize users, so I was curious if a compromised monero node is an attack vector, if its a risk I should be concerned with?","score":3,"subreddit_comment":"monerosupport","body":"In my own personal experience from what I've seen running a node (un-modified) with log level 1 the following is a screenshot of a typical log entry:[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/monero-ecosystem/PiNode-XMR/master/Screenshots/txBroadcast.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/monero-ecosystem/PiNode-XMR/master/Screenshots/txBroadcast.png)\n\nI use the above example when people ask me questions specific to remote node privacy, where the GREEN boxes highlight a wallet connecting to my node (RPC), the ORANGE box shows that same wallet broadcasting a transaction.My understanding is that with an un-modified Monero node, this is about the limit for removing privacy, linking a tx ID to a specific IP address. It is also why you should run your own node as you are trusting the operator to not be keeping these logs or scrutinizing them.\n\nIn the case of running your own node and loosing control of those logs you can reduce their size, quantity kept etc with some additional startup options:\n\nRef: [https://monerodocs.org/interacting/monerod-reference/#logging](https://monerodocs.org/interacting/monerod-reference/#logging)\n\n&gt;**--log-level**\t0-4 with 0 being minimal logging and 4 being full tracing. Defaults to 0. These are general presets and do not directly map to severity levels. For example, even with minimal 0, you may see some most important INFO entries. Temporarily changing to 1 allows for much better understanding of how the full node operates. Example:  \n&gt;  \n&gt;./monerod --log-level=1  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**--max-log-file-size**\tSoft limit in bytes for the log file (=104850000 by default, which is just under 100MB). Once log file grows past that limit, monerod creates the next log file with a UTC timestamp postfix -YYYY-MM-DD-HH-MM-SS.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;In production deployments, you would probably prefer to use established solutions like logrotate instead. In that case, set --max-log-file-size=0 to prevent monerod from managing the log files.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**--max-log-files**\tLimit on the number of log files (=50 by default). The oldest log files are removed. In production deployments, you would probably prefer to use established solutions like logrotate instead.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe above is saying that Monero keeps some quite lengthy log files. By default 50 files of \\~100MB, if true I would consider that excessive.\n\nA single 10MB file would be more than suitable for personal debugging, which I set as the default for the PiNodeXMR project.\n\nI don't see any way this can affect someone's coins. Only that a certain IP is using Monero, assuming they don't use a VPN. Tor is also an option but also assumes your hidden service address isn't linked to you personally.\n\nI'll finally say though that I'm no privacy academic, there are certainly other vectors that a creative assailant may use, but in my day to day usage I've not considered them.","score_comment":2,"id_comment":"ixn28il","comment_count":1}

I've been using monero for a few years, mostly using the command line programs.

I researched why this could be happening, but I don't fully understand the old posts, why it sometimes works and sometimes doesn't, and why I can't actually sweep all my funds anymore. Is it even possible to send all my funds to a new address? I would do it manually, but I'm unsure how to without leaving dust behind.
