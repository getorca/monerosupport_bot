"p2p server issue suddenly starts and gets resolved after sometime","I used to run the xmr node behind the same router since 2016. However I did not synch for sometime. Recently I started xmr node by downloading the blockchain import file then synching. The node synched fine. Had 64 out-peer and 100+ in-peer.

"Have I screwed up and it's it possible to fix?","I'm using the GUI wallet.

Should I have waited until it finished syncing? Have I lost my Monero?\n\nI've been reading some threads and people suggested to attempt to connect to the public (? Might be wrong term) nodes but do I still have the same ""wallet"" and will my Monero come in?\n\nI'm obviously a total newb at this - coming from Bitcoin where the wallet I used was straight forward to use.\n\nI used the exchange Kracken and it states the transfer was successful. There is no transactions on my GUI wallet tho.\n\nI've checked the logs and the downloading of the blocks is stuck at 75%..I've tried restarting but that did nothing.\n\nWhat can I do? How can I address it? I'm worried switching to a public node will wipe my incoming transaction.\n\nE: I have GUI version 0.18.2.2 which from what I gather, is the most up to date version.\n\nI have windows 10. \n\nI also have another question.

"Import outputs from file","Hey all,\n\nI have to send transactions quite frequently and usually to multiple addresses. Therefore I was wondering if there was a way to import the transaction into the GUI without having to copy paste it anymore.\n\nI noticed that there is the option to import outputs.

I am using a hot wallet with a local node.\n\nSearching for it also yields no usable results.

(Like I can't help them make their IBD or sync later on.)\n* Can someone explain me clearly what the ""# rpc settings #"" lines means.\n\nI know that my Node has two different default ports to listen on, either the P2Pnetwork on 18080 to relay Blockchain datas, peer sync time, etc. And also the port 18081 for RPC calls, like if I want to broadcast a tx to the network using my own wallet on my local network for ex.\n\nSo if by default, I just need to connect to my node using [127.0.0.1](https://127.0.0.1/):18081 If I'm using a wallet on the same machine, I don't get why do I need to write : ""rpc-restricted-bind-ip=[0.0.0.0](https://0.0.0.0/)"" and ""rpc-restricted-bind-port=18089"" in the config file.\n\nIs it to open my node to wallet on other machines within my local network, no matter the IP ?\n\n# Correct me if i'm wrong, with this config file, my node is :\n\n**A :** Not using Tor as the #tx-proxy=tor,[127.0.0.1:9050](https://127.0.0.1:9050/),16 is commented (which is what I want because I need to actually understand what I'm doing before going any further)\n\n**B :** Allowing outgoing P2P connection to get data and sync but not incoming ones to push them data and help them sync\n\n**C :** Allowing RPC connection from within my local network to wallets no matter the machine if I config them correctly, but restricting wallets from outside to use the 18089 port.\n\n(but how does it restrict anything as is allows every IP's out there with [0.0.0.0](https://0.0.0.0/) this part really confuses me)\n\nAt the end, my node is in private mode either for P2P or RPC is that correct ?\n\n# And my last questions are :\n\n\- What would you change in the ""# P2P full node settings #"" to make it open to incoming connections and be as helpful as possible to the network ?\n\n\- What would you change in the ""# rpc settings #"" to make it, secure to me and my network and open to other wallets coming from outside ? (assuming that I would like to because I know that i'll have a good uptime and enough Bandwidth)\n\n\- If I use the two settings updated to make it open, will it turn my Full node into a Full open node for P2P network and RPC ?\n\nDon't bother you with all the port forwarding stuff. I'm documenting myself on the subject.\n\nThat's it for my first post, thank you for reading through here, and I hope that someone will be nice enough to give a bit of his time to answer the point I mentioned.\n\nWish everyone an amazing day or night.","/r/monerosupport/comments/12rpavf/need_help_to_configure_the_monerodconf_of_my_node/","12rpavf"," \n    \n    ""You can use the GUI to set the node height.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

"Windows Firewall Clarification","I added the Inbound Rule for 18080, but monerod was still not getting incoming connections. I realized there was a rule that I did not create blocking incoming connections for monerod on ALL ports. One for TCP and one for UDP. After disabling the TCP one (and keeping my added rule for 18080) I was able to get incoming connections. Here is a screenshot of my [Inbound Rules](https://imgur.com/mB6ahRf).\n\nMy question is: is it insecure for me to disable this blocking? It seems to me that this allows incoming connections from ALL ports, which seems like a security risk. Is there a way I can keep that blocking rule on for all ports EXCEPT 18080? I could not find a setting like this in the Properties of the blocking rule though.

"./monerod unexpected closure error crash HELP?","Hi, I've been trying to mine monero for days. I have been using monero wallet gui for some time but always via remote node to avoid taking up too much disk space and everything has always worked as it should. Reading about mining, it was recommended to use a local node and to download the blockchain to your computer and that's what I've been trying to do for days. Doing it via monero wallet gui, when it finishes downloading the blockchain, the loading bars go back to empty and when I try to start the daemon I get a warning that the monerod process has unexpectedly closed or it doesn't simply start. I had to delete and start again to download the blockchain several times. I've had other problems too but still haven't been able to download the blockchain. Then I tried to download the blockchain directly via the terminal command ""./monerod --prune-blockchain"" without starting monero wallet gui. It seemed that everything was finally going well but, obviously, having reached 98% of the synchronization after days of download the process is stopped and the terminal says ""zsh: killed ./monerod --prune-blockchain"" with an attached mac error message which says that there is an unexpected termination of the monerod process that keeps repeating every time I run the terminal command. The error log is this: [https://logpaste.com/ZmR2Ehup](https://logpaste.com/ZmR2Ehup)\n\nI repeat that monero wallet gui had always worked via remote nodes, however, wanting to try to mine via p2pool, I wanted to download the blockchain but it seems that in my case it is impossible. Can anyone help me solve? I wouldn't want to cancel the blockchain I downloaded once again because as I said I had reached 98% and therefore I was close to it. Even trying to run monerod by starting monero wallet gui (start daemon) I always get the same unexpected closure error.
